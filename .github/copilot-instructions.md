When writing tests, ensure they are comprehensive and cover edge cases. Use descriptive names for test cases to clarify their purpose.

When adding new code, only add what was asked. Do not add extra code or features unless explicitly requested.

When writing code, always consider the performance implications. Avoid unnecessary computations and optimize for speed where possible.
